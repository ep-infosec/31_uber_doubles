=======================

Thank you for using Doubles and for helping to improve it!

Bugs
----

If you find a bug while using Doubles, please open an issue on GitHub Issues: https://github.com/uber/doubles/issues.
Any exceptions raised by Doubles that are not one of the exception classes in the ``doubles.exceptions`` module are
considered bugs. Unexpected or surprising behavior may also be considered bugs. The goal is for Doubles to be intuitive
and consistent.

Features
--------

Before working on a new feature, please open an issue to propose your idea. This is out of respect for your time.
We want to discuss new features first and don't want you to spend your time working on patches that won't be accepted.
If we agree that the feature is a good fit, you're free to make a pull request with the necessary changes.
And of course, you can always maintain a fork with any additional features you want without discussing them here first.
